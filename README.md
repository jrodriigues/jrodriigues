Hello, my name is Joao, I am 25 yo and I am from Portugal.

I am studying to become a software developer, at the moment I am learning Python and C/C++, so that's what I will be sharing the most from now.

I am open to tips and ideas and positive criticism, so if anyone that sees my code would like to leave a note or a tip on how to improve, please do, that will be very helpful!
